      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>By accessing this website or engaging ZELDIGITAL Philippines for advisory or consulting services, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, please do not use the site or our services.</p>

      <h2>2. Services</h2>
      <p>We provide strategy-first business consulting and digital marketing advisory. Unless explicitly stated in a signed agreement, services are advisory in nature and outcomes are not guaranteed.</p>

      <h2>3. No Professional Guarantees</h2>
      <p>Marketing results depend on multiple factors outside our control. We do not warrant specific revenue, ROAS, CPA, or other performance outcomes. Case studies and highlights are illustrative only.</p>

      <h2>4. Fees, Payments, and Invoicing</h2>
      <p>Pricing and scope are agreed in writing prior to engagement. Invoices are due upon receipt unless otherwise stated. Late payments may pause work. Applicable taxes (including PH VAT, if any) are additional.</p>

      <h2>5. Client Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>You agree to provide timely access to required accounts, assets, data, and stakeholders, and to ensure all information supplied is accurate and lawful.</p>

      <h2>6. Confidentiality</h2>
      <p>Each party will keep the other party’s confidential information secure and use it only for the purposes of fulfilling the engagement. We can execute an NDA on request.</p>

      <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>Unless otherwise agreed, pre-existing intellectual property remains with the original owner. Deliverables produced during an engagement become the client’s to use internally. We retain the right to reference non-sensitive, non-identifying outcomes for portfolio purposes unless you request otherwise in writing.</p>

      <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, ZELDIGITAL and its personnel will not be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages. Our total liability under any claim will not exceed the fees paid in the three (3) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.</p>

      <h2>9. Third‑Party Services</h2>
      <p>We may recommend or integrate third‑party services (e.g., analytics, scheduling, advertising platforms). These are governed by their own terms and policies and are your responsibility to review.</p>

      <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>These terms are governed by the laws of the Republic of the Philippines. For U.S. entities, ZELDIGITAL maintains a presence via a Wyoming LLC; however, Philippine law governs unless otherwise agreed in writing.</p>

      <h2>11. Changes</h2>
      <p>We may update these terms from time to time. Material changes will be reflected on this page with a revised date.</p>

      <h2>12. Contact</h2>
      <p>Questions about these terms? Email <a href="mailto:hanz@zeldigital.com">hanz@zeldigital.com</a> or call/WhatsApp <a href="tel:+639761053409">+63 976 105 3409</a>.</p>
